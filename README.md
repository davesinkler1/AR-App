Ar-App
======
This is currently at this time, my current project and it is also a school project
and the objective of me making this project is to simulate absurdism inside an app
with the focus on AR so basically in layman's term, i make some weird functions based
on user input inside the app and if the function activates then an AR object appears
on the screen

Deployment
==========
Because this is not the full android folder
i'm afraid you can't just deploy it like so

APK Installation :
Because the project is in APK-form the first thing to do is to download it from the file-sharing site but before you download it you need to make sure that third-party apps are allowed in your phone by going to: Settings > Apps and Notifications > Advanced > Special App Access  select Install Unknown Apps and then your browser to allow your phone to install third-party apps  and then after you downloaded it go to downloads on your phone and then open the app.

DISCLAIMER: The app doesn't work on phones with the API of 29 and up
