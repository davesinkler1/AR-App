Ar-App
======
This is currently at this time, my current project and it is also a school project
and the objective of me making this project is to simulate absurdism inside an app
with the focus on AR so basically in layman's term, i make some weird functions based
on user input inside the app and if the function activates then an AR object appears
on the screen

Deployment
==========
Because this is not the full android folder
i'm afraid you can't just deploy it like so
